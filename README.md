## ICP-Final-Project

This is the final project that I completed as part of the Internet Computer internship bootcamp. The bootcamp is a comprehensive program that provides participants with the skills and knowledge they need to become successful developers in the Internet Computer ecosystem. This project was the culmination of all the learning and development that I took place during the bootcamp. I am proud of the work that I have done on this project, and I believe that it demonstrates my ability to apply the skills that I have learned to real-world problems.
